            <h1 class="Dancing">Who am I?</h1>
            <br />
            <p>Hello, I’m Tiffany Locicero. Having lived a very adventurous life, I am currently in the process of transition and re-discovery.</p>
            <br />
            <p>At 20 years old you would have found me driving back and forth from Toronto to Arizona pursuing a degree in Chemical Engineering. How I ever did that drive at 20 years old is beyond me. It seemed like a perfectly natural thing to do, and only now in my 40s does it really hit me that I did that. 3500 km. 36 hours driving time. To and from AZ not once, or twice, but ten times over 5 and a half years, just me and my dog Cali… across the United States, seemingly through the middle of nowhere. I can still close my eyes and imagine I'm driving. I look over at her, and smile, knowing I am experiencing a time in my life I will always remember and be proud of. I feel safe, ambitious, like I can do anything.</p>
            <br />    
            <p>After graduating and spending a few years in the work force as a process engineer in Toronto, I decided it was time for another adventure and headed back to Arizona. It was through this period of my life’s journey, that the idea of ‘Karmalution’ came about. It just wasn’t the right time to fully pursue my ambitions.</p>
            <br />    
            <p>I feel like I have just recently closed a book on my life that has had so many exciting chapters and I am currently heading into an unknown space of life. I am excited. I am motivated. I thrive in a fast paced environment, have developed a knack for problem solving through logical thinking and feel the need to express my creativity so I have decided to pursue my love of technology and embark on the dynamic world of coding and design.</p>
            <br /></section>
            <h1 class="Dancing">What are my Goals?</h1>
            <br />
            <p>I am dedicated to become an expert web developer in a very short time while prioritizing home life and maintaining a balanced budget.  Does that seem ambitious? Well the most interesting part will be watching the development of Karmalution finally unfold. This is my second chance and I'm ready for it. Let's do this!
            <br />
            <br />
            <h1 class="Dancing">My Favorite Git Command?</h1>
            <br />
            <p>I believe that 'git commit' is the most important git command as it forms the foundation of version control for the project. It creates a snapshot of the project at that moment in time and records a history of revisions that you can revert back to if needed. 
            <br />
